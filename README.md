## Data Validation R Codes 
### Context
This repository serves as a version control to the calc_display.Rmd code used both internally by the OECD and externally by delegates to validate their data and visualise resulting rates.
It is a private repository, therefore only people with granted access can view and modify it.

 ### Branches
 The repository is divided into the following branches:
 - main: contains the most recent version of the code, as well as a dataset for each indicator that can be used to test and run the code, formatted according to the new guidelines and SDMX standards
 - old-versions: contains older versions of the code, the folder names are sorted by date

 ### Running the code
The code comes as a folder which contains the main Rmd script (calc_display.Rmd), functions, classes, and a README with information specifically related to the code.
To run the code, it is necessary to download the entire folder and to have calc_display.Rmd saved in a folder called HCQO_validation. This is normally already the case for all folders, both in main and old-version branches.
